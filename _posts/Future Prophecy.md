### Entropy
<mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Anyone remember the definition of this term from HS Physics?</mark> It's the concept that systems tend to disorganize over time. It flies directly in the face of evolution, but that's a topic for another day. 

<mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">What does the Bible say about entropy?</mark>
- <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Where we created to die?</mark> No! We were created to live forever (Genesis 3 - returning to dust); cp w/ <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Romans 8:21-22</mark> (groans, corruption, etc.)
- <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Psalms 102:25-27</mark> - <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">what happens when something gets old?</mark> It doesn't operate like it should! It creaks, groans, and wears out. Just ask your grandparents....

<mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">So how do we apply this to what's happening in the world today and that's yet to come? Why do I bring this up in a study on prophecy?</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Because Christ tells us</mark> there will be a chaotic ending to the world. 
- Brent Dube's personal belief - <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">some of this is a natural product of decay and corruption of the globe. An imperfect and entropic system simply cannot function "well" forever.</mark> It's basic, fundamental science. <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">God established these rules!</mark> But I also believe God will allow and cause events to happen that will lead to further chaos and destruction - <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">keep this distinction in mind as we study together</mark>.
	- Not every natural disaster is a sign of the end times - these horrible floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc have existed for years. But some most certainly could be interpreted to be. So let's dig in...

### Timeline
I would like to start with what Christ told His disciples before He went to the cross. This account is found in <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Matthew 24, Mark 13, and Luke 17, 21</mark>.

<mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">I will share a brief timeline of my personal belief from my study</mark>. I will note by saying there are multiple viewpoints and beliefs on the timeline by good teachers and students of the Word. My understanding of this has changed over time as I've studied further. <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">So we're going to rely heavily on the Scripture because that's ultimately what matters</mark>. If someone has another viewpoint on timeline, let's bring it up and talk about it. I certainly don't claim to know all of the answers. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">And at the end of the day, if God didn't tell us explicitly, it's not for us to know that detail with 100% certainty. That being said, there is a LOT that we do know from study in Scripture...</mark>

Really all of the gospels share a slightly different aspect of the future and it's really important to study them all together...


<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Rapture</mark> - next prophetic event to be fulfilled. <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Why do I believe in a pre-tribulation rapture?</mark>
- <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">no mention of church</mark> through much of Revelation (chapter 8:1 - chapter 18)
- <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">strong delusion</mark> - when the Holy Spirit has been removed from the earth and Satan has been cast down, we find the Antichrist arises and leads the world astray to follow him. 
- <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">The deadly wound </mark>- for everything pure and right that God does, Satan often has a cheap imitation. The Temu version, if you will. What does prophecy say about the Messiah? That He'd be bruised, beaten unrecognizably, killed, and rise again. <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">Why does antichrist have to have a deadly wound that's healed?? Ever thought about that?</mark> <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Because the Jews are looking for a messiah who will suffer like Isaiah prophesied and come back to life to give a kingdom and authority. That's why the antichrist can negotiate with Israel - because he fulfils many of the Old Testament prophecies regarding the true Messiah. He also promises what Jesus didn't - he promises peace and safety in their land (so they've gotta be in their land already) - he promises the earthly kingdom that the Jews were looking for when Jesus Christ came.</mark> They didn't understand the prophecy was split into multiple periods of time. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">Likewise, we must be careful as we attempt to study and discern future prophecy. Some of this has already past (since Christ's death but before 2025) and some of it is yet to come.</mark> I believe this is what Christ was referring to when He said to let the reader discern what was being said. There would be readers millenia in the future and they'd have a different viewpoint than the early church would.
- <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">If those who receive the mark of the beast are unsaved, then Christians would have no way of making it through the tribulation as they would be unable to buy/sell/exchange in addition to the plagues.</mark> I really don't see a case for the church to endure the tribulation. Those who "endure to the end being saved (paraphrase)," is likely referring to those who refuse the mark of the beast but are saved during the tribulation time. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">They have enough faith to trust God for salvation over antichrist and refuse the number.</mark> They would no doubt be persecuted but also would have minimal way of survival. <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Those who endure to death or the end of the tribulation without taking the mark due to their faith in God, would be saved (or essentially are truly saved).</mark>

<mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">Signing of the peace treaty with Israel</mark> - this marks the beginning of the 70th week of Daniel
Half-way through the 70th week, which is a 7-year time span, the peace treaty will be broken and antichrist will invade Israel (1260 days).

<mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Antichrist then sets up the abomination of desolation</mark> (at the 1260 mark we have the abomination) which is the desecration of the Temple by requiring worship of himself (remember, he's imitating Christ so the Jews likely will go along with this, other than those who have discernment and understand what's truly happening from Daniel and the New Testament)

<mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">Christ returns with His army from heaven</mark>, overthrows the antichrist, and establishes the thousand year reign. During this time, Satan is bound in the bottomless pit and will return at the end of this period.

<mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">Satan wages 1 final war against the Lord and is ultimately defeated and cast into the lake of fire for eternity. </mark>

<mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">The Great White Throne Judgment judges those who are unsaved and they are sentenced into the lake of fire for eternity.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">The Bemaseat judgment occurs after the Great White Throne Judgement </mark>where Christians are awarded our crowns or rewards to cast at Jesus' feet. I do not agree with the thought that the Bemaseat judgment occurs during the tribulation as the crowns and things we'd cast at Jesus' feet would be destroyed and would not include all of the Christians who will be converted during the tribulation period. I could see an argument for this occurring at the very end of the tribulation and before the millennial reign, but I find this difficult to reconcile with scripture. 


<mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">Let's get into what Jesus said...</mark>

### The Disciples' Question(s) - <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Matthew 24:3</mark>; Mark 13:4; Luke 21:7
- "When shall these things be?" Referring to the destruction of the Temple
- What shall be the sign of thy coming?
- And of the end of the world?

Note - these are <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">three different questions</mark>. <mark style="background: #3EFF00E0;">How many have already happened?</mark>
1 - <mark style="background: #FF5C0080;">The Temple destruction by the Romans in 70AD</mark>
2 - <mark style="background: #FF5C0080;">Christ's coming?</mark> There's really <mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;">2 more</mark> - the Rapture, not likely what they're discussing here. They wanted to know when the Kingdom would occur which I would take to be either the millennial reign or the new heaven and new earth.
3 - <mark style="background: #FF5C0080;">when will the world end?</mark> Even the disciples knew back then that the earth's lifespan was and is finite

Christ dutifully answers each of these...
1) He cautions against false prophets numerous times - <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Matthew 24:4-5</mark>, 11, 23-26; Mark 13:5-6, 21-22; Luke 21:8
2) He warns of coming disasters - <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Matthew 24:6-8</mark>; Mark 13:7-8; Luke 21:9-11
	1) beginning of sorrows - this is pre-tribulation and early tribulation (Brent's viewpoint)
3) abomination of desolation (vs <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">15</mark>) - there's some who interpret this to be the Roman destruction of the Temple. It's possible, but that doesn't align fully with Daniel in my view. It's possible that there's two meanings, but I take this to refer to the antichrist during the tribulation; Mark 13:14; <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Luke 21:20-24</mark>
4) Persecution of believers (<mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Matthew 24:9-10</mark>)
5) Great tribulation - <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">vs 21-22</mark>; Mark 13:19-20
6) The return of Christ - <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">vs 27-28</mark> (<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Rapture</mark>), 30-31 (<mark style="background: #FF5C0080;">2nd coming</mark>); <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Mark 13:26-27</mark> (<mark style="background: #FF5C0080;">2nd coming</mark>); Luke 21:27-28
	1) there's two returns of Christ
		1) <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The Rapture</mark> (comes in the clouds) - <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">vs 32</mark>
		2) <mark style="background: #FF5C0080;">The 2nd Personal Physical coming to the earth</mark>
			1) I take this return of Christ to be the referring to the 2nd physical return of Christ. <mark style="background: #00FFD3E0;">He gathers his elect, the 144,000, at Jerusalem and begins the millennial reign (see Revelation 14</mark>). The distinction here is that the world would see Him rather than a "catching up" into heaven to be with the Lord.
			2) This return begins with the calling of the 144,000 at the end of the tribulation. These are the sealed Jews who live on the earth through the tribulation and are witnesses to the world of God's true salvation through the real Christ.<mark style="background: #FBFF00E0;"> Naturally only God can protect them because they would be destroyed by the rest of those who believe the delusion of the antichrist.</mark>
		3) vs <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">32's</mark> parable then takes us back to the rapture of the church; Mark 13:28-31; <mark style="background: #E100FFBA;">Luke 21:29-33</mark>


### Megan's question - rapture of children
- God's will is that none should perish (John 3)
- There are witnesses God sends for those to be saved
- I believe we'll see some answers to this throughout the study, but I don't want to disregard the good question
- Do we want to dig into the concept of the age of accountability at some point?
	- There's a difference between knowing right and wrong and discerning right vs wrong - Adam and Eve knew right and wrong in the garden. But their eyes weren't opened until they ate of the fruit and they could discern good and evil. Good and evil are different from right and wrong. Right and wrong involves knowing I should and should not do this. Discerning good and evil gets to Romans 1 - these things are a law of themselves because we innately know them. It's different for every child.

Are there any topics we want to get into deeper? My goal is to wrap this up in 1-2 weeks so we don't drag it out too far, but I want to cover the depth we want to cover together.

#### Subsequent study:
- Antichrist
- Daniel 9-12
- 2 Thessalonians 2
- Battles - Armageddon in particular, what other conflicts will be given
- Judgments - Bemaseat, Great White Throne, Nations (Matthew 25)
- Ezekiel 37-38
